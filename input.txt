Alicia was born to Doctor James Marcus and had a happy childhood, but developed progeria , a rare and deadly disease that caused Alicia to prematurely age at an accelerated rate. Desperate to save his daughter, Marcus began searching for a cure and eventually invented the T-virus, which cured Alicia's progeria. However, the T-virus was discovered to have the effect of turning those who were infected with it into the Undead, causing Marcus to want to discontinue using the T-virus. In response, Marcus' partner, Doctor Alexander Isaacs, had Marcus murdered by Albert Wesker. Alicia barely avoided seeing the murder and was then raised by Isaacs, having become owner of 50% of Umbrella with her father's death.
